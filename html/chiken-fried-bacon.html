        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika.</li>
        <li>2 large eggs.</li>

    <h3>How to Make Chiken Fried Bacon Step-By-Step</h3>    
    <ol>
        <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and set a wire rack inside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Meanwhile, cut bacon in half crosswise and season evenly on both sides with multi-purpose seasoning.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, salt, pepper, and paprika in a shallow bowl. Alternatively, season flour with additional multi-purpose seasoning blend. Whisk eggs, beer, and syrup together in a separate shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Coat each piece of bacon lightly in seasoned flour. Then coat in egg mixture, allowing the excess to drip off. Coat once more in flour mixture; set aside until all pieces are coated and oil is hot.</li>
        <li>Working a few pieces at a time, fry each piece in hot oil, flipping occasionally, until crispy golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Maintain the oil temperature between 330 and 350 degrees F (165 to 175 degrees C) while cooking. Drain bacon on the prepared wire rack. Repeat with remaining bacon.</li>
        <li>Serve with ranch dressing for dipping.</li>        
    </ol>
